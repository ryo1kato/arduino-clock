# LED Minutes Repeater Clock

A clock with blinking LED telling you time. Useful if you’re myopic and don’t have glasses or smartphone within reach of your hand when you’re in the bed (like me, with my two kids blocking my both sides) https://github.com/ryo1kato/arduino-clock/tree/trinket-neopixel

Using ATtiny85 micro controller and DS3231 RTC chip with "smart" RGB LED WS2812.
